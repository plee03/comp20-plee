1. This Git repository serves as a portfolio for the work that I have done in 
Web Programming.

2. My favorite assignments were Mapchat and the corresponding server assignment.
Those were compelling to me since they produce tangible things and required me
to implement key ideas for websites.

3. I know now much more about HTML, Javascript, client and server side
development compared to what I knew at the beginning of the course. 

4. The most important thing that I learned in this course is knowing how 
to make use of existing implementations such as APIs. There seems to be an API
for nearly everything, waiting to be used. For instance, in my final group 
project we were able to make use of the Last.fm and Spinitron APIs to build
our database, and it was mostly a matter of figuring out how to use clients
that already existed. Another example where I applied this was in my Concurrent
Programming class, where I used a Javascript library for graph visualization.

5. I would like to delve further into lower level details in networking and 
the workings of servers.
