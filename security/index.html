Security and Privacy Assessment
by Peter Lee

<h1>Introduction</h1>
This document describes security vulnerabilities in a Heroku app that provides the following functionality:
<ol>
    <li>A HTTP POST API that takes a login, a latitude, a longitude, and a message, and stores the data
    in a database</li>
    <li>A HTTP GET API that returns the most recent entry from a login specified as a query.</li>
    <li>An index page that formats displays all data entered into the database.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>
    Testing was mostly performed by entering appropriate urls into the Firefox web browser to 
    do GET requests with queries, and the curl command to do POST requests with the appropriate
    parameters. There was a small amount of black box testing, but the vulnerabilities were mostly
    discovered upon observation of the source code, white box testing.
</p>
<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
There are several important privacy and security issues with this Heroku app.
<ul>
    <li> Code can be injected into the index page, which can be used to make visitors
    see unwanted content, redirect visitors to different pages, and so on. This is a vulnerability
    of high importance.</li>
    <li> Unwanted data can be inserted into the Heroku app's database, which uses up allotted database
    space and could disrupt searches</li>
    <li> Arbitrary data can be obtained from the Heroku app's database, which is a potential privacy risk.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Issues Found</h1>

<h3>XSS vulnerability</h3>
This vulnerability affects the index.html page and the POST /sendLocation API.
<h4>Severity: High</h4>
<p>
    Because messages are not sanitized when they are sent to the database via .../sendLocation, 
    any HTML or Javascript code can be sent to the database. When this code is retreived and
    shown on the page index.html, the code can be run, which a high security risk.
</p>
<img class="image" src="XSS1.png" alt="XSS command" />
<p>
    The above image shows the curl command that can inject code. Note the code in the message
    parameter.
</p>
<img class="image" src="XSS2.png" alt="Injecting html for image" />
<p>
    The above image shows an image that was injected via the previous command. While this
    example is relatively innocuous, even Javascript code can be run, which is a severe vulnerability.
    This problem can be fixed by sanitizing the message parameter on the server, and removing characters 
    needed to indicate HTML code such as &lt;, &gt;.
</p>
<h3>Adding additional fields</h3>
This vulnerability affects the POST API.
<h4>Severity: Low</h4>
<p>
    Because the object representing the parsed parameter is nearly directly added to the database,
    any additional parameters will also be inserted with the object. This is mainly an unwanted
    inconvenience, as this can use up unnecessary data and disrupt queries to the database.
</p>
<img class="image" src="morefields2.png" alt="Command to add more fields"/>
<p>
    The above image shows a POST request done using curl, with the additional key-value pair
    "NOTAREALFIELD=QWERTYUIOP", and the successful response it receives.
</p>
<img class="image" src="morefields3.png" alt="Showing documents with more fields"/>
<p>
    Looking into the database itself reveals that the additional fields were in fact added to the
    database.
    This problem can be fixed by explicitly assigning the appropriate object attributes to an initially
    empty object, instead of directly inserting the parsed parameters. This way, only desired parameters
    are inserted into the database.
</p>
<h3>Modifying queries to Mongodb database</h3>
This vulnerability affects the GET /getLatest.json API. 

<h4>Severity: Medium</h4>
<p>
    When this API queries its database, it searches for the parsed query's value. If the query happens to
    be a key-value pair corresponding to a Mongodb operator such as $ne, these operators then affect the
    query. By using the $ne operator, any arbitrary document in the same collection can be returned, which
    is a privacy risk.
</p>
<img class="image" src="mongo.png" alt="JSON result from altering find query" />
<p>
    The above image shows the URL used for the HTTP Get request, and the result that it returns. While this
    particular document can already be accessed on the index page, it is conceivable that this exploit could return
    a document in the same collection that is not exposed on the index.html page.
    This problem can be fixed by ensuring that the parsed query is a string, using isString for example.
</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    There are several critical security issues in the given application as described. Following the solutions specified 
    for each issue should solve the vulnerabilities, improving the security of the application. Other possible recommendations are
    limiting the amount of POST requests that can be sent and stored in the database, as this could be prohibitive for
    space.
