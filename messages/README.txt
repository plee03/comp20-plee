Is it possible to request the data from a different origin?
In general, the answer seems to be no, following from the same origin policy. 

From Wikipedia: "XMLHttpRequest requests follow the browser's same-origin 
policy, and will therefore only succeed if they are made to the host that 
served the original web page."

However, there seems to be an exception in this case, as the request is to a
different origin but is still succeeding.
